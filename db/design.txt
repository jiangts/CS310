I have CRUD pages for properties, and 
have a read page for objects. I can make the rest of the CRUD for the without much difficulty?
Create:
name
uuid (auto-generated)
actual device connected? THIS NEEDS TO BE A FIELD, right? Maybe UUID is only generated when you connect to the real object?

what about assigning type?
Should the device itself assign type?

Ok two user stoies.
1. User creates object online first, then connects smart object to it.
Smart phone connect to smob. Tell it to do register request.
What does this entail? You want to 
a. retrieve a UUID.
b. associate the device with yourself.
c. assoc it with a property.
d. give the object a type
e. give it a name
f. figure out WHICH VIRTUAL OBJ to associate it with!!
name dropdown or type in a new name



2. Register the device in virtual world when you register in real world. 
Again, do it through the smartphone. Smart phone does WHAT on smob's behalf?

phone connects to smob via bluetooth. Phone provides smob with uname and pword for internet. 
Then it tells smob to perform registration request.

The register API:
send user token
send object type (within device)
send name?? <-- provided through bluetooth
send property??
send register with object already in db or create new obj

get UUID
It has to do a create request for an object, AND a thermostat
